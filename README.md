# Component ideas

Social components for a-frame sites. Banter, but decentralized.

### Site explorer UI

# Site ideas

Ideas for a-frame sites to build

## Hub

My personal site. Portals to all my other sites and socials.

## Greenhouse

A simple island with a greenhouse, ported from Banter

## Linux Terminal site

Access a linux server in virtual space. Enter an domain name or IP address, login and a physical terminal will appear, alongside server and container statistics.
